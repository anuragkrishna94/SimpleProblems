# SimpleProblems
- Solutions to simple algorithmic problems are presented here
- For the Longest Palindromic sub string problem, the recommended solution is to start from the centre character and spread outwards in both directions.
- I used another approach where I converge based on the first character encountered

> As you can see, the convergance approach stands in the top 14% of the solution. Maybe some further memory optimizations can make this solution better.
